(Typescript Complete Developer's Guide)[https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/]
course that mimic some of the common features used by popular web frameworks.

Model Classes will be used to handle data that is used to represent Users, Blog Posts,
Images, etc.

View Classes will handle HTML and events caused by the user (like clicks).
